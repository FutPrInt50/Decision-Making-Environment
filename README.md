Data, in the format of a .csv file, can be loaded by pressing the "Load .csv file" link.

Two types of plots are available: Parallel Coordinates and Scatter.
Parallel Coordinates have a drop-down menu for selecting the axis where the colormap will be applied to.
It is possible to select "None" for providing just plain colors.

Datapoints can be selected by selecting a range of data on each axis. The selections will propagate to the other plots, by greying out the non-selected points.
On the scatter plots it is possible to select using the drop-down menus the X, Y and colour axes.
